### Note

This mock marketplace is setup to use a graph server, the tutorial generates the bulk of its code by using tools provided by [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com)

A decentralized(mostly) way of indexing blockchain data. At the time goerli testnet funds are running dry so I figured I would not bother deploying/using it.

To see an example of a graph/subgraph server that this mock nft marketplace can then use, please see [graph-nft-marketplace-fcc](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/graph-nft-marketplace-fcc)
